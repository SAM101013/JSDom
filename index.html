    <p>Every element, from the grand...</p>

    <h2>Imagine the Stage:</h2>       
      
        
      <p>Think of your web page as a stage, where each element like an image or button is an actor. Now, the DOM controls the spotlight, deciding who's visible and who's taking a curtain call.
      
       Enter the Toggle:
       toggle function acts like a backstage director. Its job is to flip the switch on an element's visibility - hidden one moment, shining bright the next!</p>
      
      <h2>How it Works:</h2>
      
      <p> Pick Your Player: First, you tell the toggle which element you want to control. This is like pointing at the actor you want to make disappear.
      Check the Spotlight: The toggle peeks behind the curtain to see if the element is already hidden. If it is, it yells "Lights, camera, action!" and makes the element visible.
      Reverse the Trick: But if the element is already visible, the toggle whispers "Shhh, take a break" and hides it away.
      Putting it on Stage:</p>
      
      <h2>To use the toggle, you need three things:</h2>
      
      <p>The Script: Write some JavaScript code that calls the toggle function. Think of it as the director's instructions.
      The Button: This is your backstage lever, triggering the toggle when clicked. Just like the director pressing a hidden button.
      The Actor: Choose the element you want to hide and show, like our image or button. This is the one taking the spotlight or hiding in the wings.
      Practice Makes Perfect:
      
      Experiment with different elements and triggers to see the toggle in action. You can even combine it with other functions to create exciting interactions on your web page. Remember, the more you play, the better you'll understand the magic of the DOM toggle!</p>
    <div>
      <img src="supersophb.jpg" alt="city" id="myImage" class="centered halfSize">


      <button onclick="toggleImage()">Now you see me..</button>
      <p>
        Above me is the JS DOM toggle function, play peek-a-boo with website elements! Like a backstage director, this function hides/shows elements on your whim. Pick an element, click a button, and presto! Hidden becomes visible, visible turns shy. Remember, toggle's the switch, changing "display" from block to none and back again. Now go play, make your elements disappear and reappear, and become a master of the web's hide-and-seek game!</p>
      <p>This page was designed learning about JSDom. I wanted to use my new skills to showcase JSDom & help other begginer coders to learn all about the magic of JSDom</p>
      <p>So, now you have the tools to make your web pages truly dynamic! Go forth, young programmer, and master the art of the toggle!</p> 
        <h3>Bonus Tip: Keep an eye on the "display" property in your code. That's where the toggle stores whether an element is "block" (visible) or "none" (hidden).</h3>

      <p>So thre we have it code heroes! I hoped you enjoyed this journey through the basics of JS Dom!

        "I have been engrossed! Embarking on a JS Dom adventure during my Master Developer course with Codenation has been a blast! 
        Picture this: With a sprinkle of JavaScript magic, I've crafted a dynamic web page where users can whimsically swap images just by interacting with a playful input. Thanks to the enchantment of event listeners and the charm of jsdom, selecting a new image becomes a delightful journey. No need for server-side fuss â€“ it's all about the joy of client-side interactions. Join the fun, and let the images dance to your input whims in this whimsical coding escapade!"</p>
